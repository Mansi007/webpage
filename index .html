			<h1>Blogger</h1>
<p>The easiest way of describing a blogger is someone who is known primarily for their website – it might be photo-based like Tommy Ton or The Sartorialist – or written, such as Susannah Lau of Style Bubble or Chiara Ferragni of The Blonde Salad. When they first emerged over a decade ago, it marked a huge milestone in terms of democratising the fashion industry. Fashion bloggers have a point of view, a certain taste and a unique way of presenting and documenting fashion – whether visual or written.</p>
<br>
<br>

<p>The most successful of these have learnt to monetise their blogs in terms of advertising, campaigns and brand projects. Some bloggers are also known as influencers because of the success of their blogs (take Ferragni, who is a celebrity and brand now in her own right, and whose recent wedding created serious social media traction). The future of blogging is unsure – some (Pernille Teisbaek, for example) are closing their blogs because of a dip in traffic, thanks to the rise of Instagram.</p><br><br>

<h1>Influencers</h1>
<p>Influencers don't typically have blogs or their own platforms outside of social media. In the past they might have been called 'It girls'; they're paid to attend fashion shows, designer dinners and fashion parties because it earns the brand kudos to have them there. Currently, the worth of an influencer is rooted in how many followers they have and who their followers are – if his or her Instagram Insights indicate that their following is loyal, wealthy and aged between 25 and 35, then they're in luck.</p>
